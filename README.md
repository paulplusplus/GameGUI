# GameGUI

## What is this?
This was originally a small project we could write for our software engineering class as a grade boost. The only requirement stipulated was that it had to be written in Java, but the GUI library was our choice.

I had previous experience with JavaFX, so I was confident that I would be able to create the GUI in a reasonable amount of time. 

I completed and presented it on the first day of presentations, and qualified for the boost.

## How do I run it?
I compiled the game into a JAR file, so as long as you have java installed on your machine, you should be capable of running it.

Simply type:
* java -jar Project2aMane.jar

Following this, you should get a game initialization prompt to show up on your screen. Set it up, and press accept. Enjoy!
